# Survival Analysis
You will find below :
  - a **jupyter** notebook, that fit a Cox’s proportional hazard model model from medical data to predict the survival time of a patient having a lung cancer.
  This challenge and these training and test data are provided by the Owkin company.

## Getting Started

### Tools

**Language**  
Python

**Model**  
I choose the *Cox’s proportional hazard model* model because it
- Works for both quantitative predictive variables and categorical variables
- Extends survival analysis methods to simultaneously assess the effect of several risk factors on survival time.

**Api**  
*Lifelines* which is an implementation of survival analysis in Python
